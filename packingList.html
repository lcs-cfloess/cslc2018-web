        <p>The weather at this time is very unpredictable so please check the weather before you come. We will have an update as we get closer to the conference of what to expect.

<br>
<br>
There will be times where we will be outside and it is incredibly important that you are ready for the weather and conditions so you can make the most of the activity. Ensure you bring clothes you are not afraid to get dirty, some of the activities may result in stains.
<br>
<br>
Hopefully all of you have completed the survey and have a general idea of the activities you will be participating in during activity time. Knowing your choices, we ask that you dress accordingly.
<br>
<br>
<div class="indent">
-If you are working out or participating in gym games we require that you have <strong>indoor running shoes</strong>.
<br>
<br>
-For some of the outdoor activities (i.e. walking in the woods and nature photography), the trails may be muddy depending on the weather so make sure that you have <strong>shoes that can get dirty or rain boots if needed</strong>.
<br>
<br>
 -For field fun, capture the flag, running on campus and the low elements course, <strong>outdoor running shoes that you don’t mind getting dirty</strong> are required to make the most of it.
</div>
<br>
<br>
*Note for all activities there is time to change if needed*
<br>
<br>
For dress throughout the conference, we are asking you to follow our Lakefield College School “clean casual” guidelines. Pants are not to have any rips or tears and shirts should be long enough to tuck in pants and cover shoulders, other than those guidelines you can  wear whatever comfortable clothing you like, and remember that the goal is for you to be able to move around and be active. (ex. Jeans, Khakis, Leggings etc.)
<br>
<br>
Everyone will receive a POD shirt on the day of the conference and we encourage you to wear it as much as you can as it identifies your POD. For the colours we have decided to go with the colours of the rainbow to support L.G.B.T.Q.A+. We are ecstatic to have a colourful conference!
<br>
<br>
Some special notes about the days:
<br>
<br>
<div class="indent">
-Wednesday night for opening ceremonies instead of your formal school wear: wear something that represents your school spirit! (ex: sports jersey, a school sweater etc.)
<br>
<br>
-Thursday we ask you wear your POD shirts for the day (you will be able to change for activity time)
<br>
<br>
-Friday you are more then welcome to wear your pod shirt again or another outfit entirely!
<br>
<br>
-Friday night is our formal dinner we ask that you wear a semi formal outfit
<br>
<br>
-Saturday is our last full day at the conference so we are asking that you wear your pod shirts one last time
<br>
<br>
-For sunday wear some comfy clothes for your travel back to school.
<br>
<br>
-For shoes you can wear whatever you would like, we encourage you to bring a pair of running shoes, a nicer pair of shoes and a casual pair as well.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
FOR ADVISORS:
<br>
<br>
You are more than welcome to participate in the school spirit wear on the Wednesday night, however the dress code for the rest of the conference will be business casual. Students will be doing some outdoor activities that you are welcome to participate in as well, dressing according to the weather is important.
