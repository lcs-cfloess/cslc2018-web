        <h1>Hello and Welcome Student Leaders!</h1>

        <p>It is our absolute pleasure to welcome everyone to Lakefield College School for the 2018 CAIS Senior Student Leadership Conference. Our 315 acre community is situated 2 hours northeast of Toronto on the shores of Lake Katchewanooka on the traditional territory of the Mississauga and Anishinaabe First Nations.

</br>
</br>
As participants of the 2018 conference, during your stay at LCS you will have the opportunity to experience our beautiful campus. You’ll be immersed in our diverse LCS culture with opportunities to take part in many of our school’s beloved activities and experiences.
</br>
</br>

During the conference, you’ll be exploring new ways in which you can sharpen your leadership skills, creating a toolbox of skills that you’ll be able to bring home with you to further develop initiatives in your own school and community!
</br>
</br>
We are excited for you to interact with our inspiring keynote speakers, as well as engage in sessions and workshops aimed at helping you become more confident leaders.
</br>
</br>
For our conference, we have chosen the following four pillars as our framework; Environmental Stewardship, Social Responsibility, Digital Citizenship and Personal Leadership Development. With these pillars we will be “Finding our Footing” and learning how we can make a positive meaningful difference in our schools and the world.</br>
</br>
We’re ecstatic to be meeting all of you and hosting you in our home, a campus we simply call “The Grove”.</br>
</br>
</br>
Your directors,
</br>
</br>
</br>
Robyn, Joe, Allie and Noah
