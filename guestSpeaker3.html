            Joel specializes in leadership, success, and what holds us back.


Mostly, he is hired as a keynote speaker or workshop facilitator, but he also does some consulting, coaching, and other special projects.
He works with ambitious people and organizations: teachers, students, engineers, non-profits, companies, and everyone else who's trying to change the world.* (*Interestingly, they often won't say it that way, even though it's accurate.)
He's hilarious and engaging, but his stories and demonstrations (like playing with a few hundred mousetraps) always have a deeper purpose and message.
He strives for integrity in his personal life: He walks his talk.
He's experienced and trustworthy on the stage: He has spoken to thousands of students, educators, and other professionals across North America since 2006.


Overall: Joel teaches people to be more creative, caring, and insightful, so they can be more successful.
